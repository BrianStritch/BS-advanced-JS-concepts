    the accumulator will default to the first element  in the array. In this case that element was zero,  
    and the accumulation process starts with the second element in the array, so 1 is added to 0.

 * As a final thought experiment,  
consider some of the other ways you could  manipulate this teamMembers array using reduce.  
Think about how you could restructure it into  an object similar to the one we just created,  
but instead of totaling the experience for each  profession, you instead provide an array of the  
names of those employees. What about if there  were 100 employees and 20 different professions,  
and you wanted to filter out only the ones in a specific profession and find the one with the most experience?
All of this could be done using combinations of map, filter and reduce.
